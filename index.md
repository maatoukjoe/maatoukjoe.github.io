   b
   c
   ```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic HID Generation

Create a simple text file called `example.txt`:

```
KEYBOARD
Hello, World!
```

Run the command:

```bash
python happy_frog.py example.txt
```

This will simulate typing "Hello, World!" on the connected device.

### Example 2: Advanced HID Commands

You can also use modifiers in your commands. For example:

```
KEYBOARD
SHIFT
A
```

This will simulate pressing "Shift + A".
